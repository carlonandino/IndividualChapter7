<h3> All fun and games aside let us take a moment to inform you about net security.

<p>
  Gaming, using apps, and surfing can be really fun ways to spend your time but even when having fun
 we should be aware of some of the dangers out there. Our digital information can be very important
 and sharing it can be risky but theres so much information that we share all the time without even
 knowing it. This page is coded to show you just a few bits of information that a site can get from
 you with little or no input from the user. Now some of these bits of information you might have actually
 given and not known or remembered. So its important to be careful with what information you give
 away and who you give it to.
